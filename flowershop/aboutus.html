		<h1>About Janet Daisy</h1>
		<p>Janet Daisy (left) was born May 27th, 1939 in Gotham City. She moved to Bohemia when she was just six years old because her parents had been killed.
		She was raised by her butler, Alfred Pennyworth. She was accepted into Harvard her junior year in high school as she was a very bright young lady. She
		graduated a year early at the top of her class. She went on to Harvard to major in Metamorphic rocks. Half-way through her second freshman semester, she
		began to lose interest in her highly exciting metamoprhic rocks. Janet desired to grow plants and flowers so much she turned her dorm into a greenhouse.
		This greatly displeased her roommate and Janet was consequently expeled from Harvard. It was then she returned to her home in Bohemia to start on her flower buisness.
		<p>Janet now lives above her blossoming flower shop in Bohemia. She likes moonlit walks on the beach, pi&ntilde;a coladas and tall German guys. Her hobbies include
		knitting, flower keeping, sifting dirt, and playing with rocks. Doesn't she sound enticing gentlemen?! But wait! There's more!
		She also can cook, clean, and cut your hair as well as maintain your garden with the freshest and prettiest of flowers around! Oh boy!</p>
