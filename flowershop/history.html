		<h1>History of Janet's Flower Power</h1>
		<p>Janet's Flower Power was founded on April 29th, 1998 in Bohemia. The flower shop started off as a small local buisness. It was not until 5 years later when Kirk Rodriguez walked in
		asking for 5 dozen roses for his girlfriend he would be proposing to that day. Kirk was a widely renowned log cabin crafstmen, working for his company Sawing Logs Inc.
		Once word got out about how fantastic Janet's flowers were, it was not long before the little flower shop was inundated with dozens of customers. 
		Janet's buisness took off with a bang and she has Kirk to thank for that.</p>
		<p>Nowadays, Janet is recieving national attention across the nation. Her flowers are touted as the brightest, healthiest and
		highest quality flowers around. Flower Power touts the widest range of flower arrangements for a variety of occasions.
		Their prices also remain some of the cheapest and you get the most bang for your buck. Flower Power does not do any big ads. We believe
		that best way to advertise is the use of your tulips. What in carnations are you waiting for?! Don't be a pansy and come on clover to
		Janet's Flower Power located in Bohemia, NY at 456 Main Street in Bohemia, NY 11716!
