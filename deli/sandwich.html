		<p>The Celtic Tiger is an award winning sandwich exclusive to Dana's Deli! This sandwich is a hybrid of old
		Irish and Scottish traditons amixed with Dana's special concoctions. Freshly cut salami, ham and provolone cheese are
		piled onto on our oven toasted bun with a scrumptious secret sauce, an old family recipe! This sandwich can only be found here
		at Dana's Deli! In addition to the Celtic Tiger being tasty and original, it also very healthy for you! Only 550 calories and 20 grams of
		protein! If you purchase ten of these, we give you a free t-shirt as a way of saying thanks for your loyalty! </p>
