# basicwebdesign
Select projects from the Basic Web Design course showcasing use of HTML and CSS.
The importance of a neat and easy to navigate website was discussed thoroughly in this course.
Creativitiy and originality wwere encouraged as you will see. Throughout my projects I would incorporate clever, humuorous, silly easter eggs to help spice up the nature of the project.
